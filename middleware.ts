// https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/middleware

// Middleware allows you to run code before a request is completed.
// Then, based on the incoming request, you can modify the response by
// rewriting, redirecting, modifying the request or response headers, or responding directly.

// Middleware runs before cached content and routes are matched. See Matching Paths for more details.
